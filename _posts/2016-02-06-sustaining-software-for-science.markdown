Participating in the third [WSSSPE](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/) workshop was not only a pleasure. The workshop [organizers](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/organizers/) brought together international participants providing [contributions across both days](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/agenda/) from a broad range of interests and perspectives, ranging from training in essential skills through to new forms of software credit. The report back from the workshop is soon to be released, look out for it.
